## Reflection 

This Project was final project for React course. took about 6 hours to finish.


At last the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router v6, JS, CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
